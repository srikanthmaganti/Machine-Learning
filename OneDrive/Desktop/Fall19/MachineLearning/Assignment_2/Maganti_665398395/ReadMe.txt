For the Question 4:
a)
Set the path file inside the code 
Run the mnist1NNdemo code
The main_function will get the test error and training examples
Then plot the curve for Test Error and Training Examples

Don't forget the Close the figure

Then It will start to run the code for Cross Validation
It will print the error rate for each cross validation for different n

Plot the curve for no of folds and cross validation error for different n

For the Question 4:
b)
Set the path file inside the code
Run the iris1NNboundary code
It will print the Training Error Rate when we changed 10 values

And the decision boundary figure will be drawn for X12

CLOSE the Figure then only we can go for next iteration
The same continuous for all the different values.
