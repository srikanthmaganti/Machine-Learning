There is a class called spam and in spam there are 3 functions
They are 
1.Spammain
2.plot_line_chart
3.spamcollection

Just import SMSSpamCollection as the filename and put SMSSpamCollection in the same folder then run the entire file
In the cmd, you can be able to see the list of values given in the question 4 and plots also will be plotted seperately.
